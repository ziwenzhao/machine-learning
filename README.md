The program is based on MATLAB.

There are some training digital images. 

The program uses Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to initial the weights of the neural network. 

Then it uses Backpropagation (BP) algorithm to train the neural network to recognize the training images.

If the system receives a new digital image, it should recognize it and gives a correct result.
